# SF Local COVID Data

The [SF COVID stie](https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/adm5-wq8i/) has visualizations for the cumulative number
of cases in each part of the city. I want to visualize trends in cases across the city, which is currently not
possible. I also want to make it easier to vizualize the finer granularity data which is available on the site.
