# SF Local COVID Data

The [SF COVID site](https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/adm5-wq8i/) has visualizations for the cumulative number
of cases in each part of the city. I want to visualize trends in cases across the city, which is currently not
possible. I also want to make it easier to vizualize the finer granularity data which is available on the site.

## Current status:

- [x] Script to query and accumulate SF data API
- [ ] Figure out why cron job is not working
- [ ] MapBox visualization for geo data
- [ ] Time series visualization per neighborhood
- [ ] UI to select location and view historical trends
